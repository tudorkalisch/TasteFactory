# TasteFactory
This is a backend project designed to handle recipes. 
I've created a list of ingredients to be able to create recipes and find a way to recommend other ingredients when we find a recipe where we do not have all the ingredients. This will be used on the web project. The flow that we are using right now is getting recommended ingredients by type or type and calories. Check Ingredient in model folder
